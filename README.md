# App Support → DevOps | Real Incident Journey

This repository documents my hands-on journey transitioning from **Application Support / IT Operations** into **DevOps**, by fixing real-world, production-like incidents.

Each week focuses on a specific operational problem:
- A **broken system or application**
- Root cause analysis
- Incident resolution
- Preventive actions

This is not a tutorial repository.
It is an **incident-driven, production mindset journey**.
